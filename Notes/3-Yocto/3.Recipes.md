## 1. Customize Image Recipes

You can customize image recipes to tailor the output image to your project's requirements. There are two types of image recipes: application recipes and image recipes.

Recipe describes:
- where you get source code
- which patches to apply
- Configuration options
- Compile options (library dependencies)
- Install
- License
### Application Recipe:

- An application recipe defines how to build and include a specific application or software component in your image.
- It should include the following information:
	1. `SRC_URI`: The location of the source code for the application.
	2. Dependencies on this source code.
	3. Compilation of dependencies and source code.
	4. Installation of executables in the desired location, such as `/usr/bin`.

For example, in a `.bb` file, you might have:

```bb
SRC_URI = "git://example.com/repo.git" 
DEPENDS = "libxyz"
```

This example specifies the source code location and a dependency on the "libxyz" library.

### **Image Recipe:

- Image recipes are target-dependent and can be found under the path `/recipes-core/images/`.
- These recipes define what should be included in the final target image.
- Customize image recipes based on your project's requirements.

With these steps, you can create and add new layers to your Yocto Project, customize application and image recipes, and tailor your custom Linux distribution to your specific needs.

## 2. Customize and Create Recipe for Application

To create and customize a Yocto application recipe, it must reside in a layer. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Layer:**

```Bash
bitbake-layers create-layer ../meta-application
```

2. **Add the New Layer to bitbake-layers:**

```BASH
bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-application
```

3. **Create Recipe Using recipetool:**

```BASH
recipetool create -o application.bb <repo_link>
recipetool create -o <name>.bb -S <commip> <repo_link>
recipetool create -o <name>.bb -V <tag> <repo_link>
recipetool create -o <name>.bb -B <branch> <repo_link>
```

Ensure the new layer is recognized by Yocto by updating `layer.conf`

```Bash
# We have recipes-* directories, add to BBFILES
BBFILES += "${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bb \
            ${LAYERDIR}/recipes-*/*/*.bbappend"
```

Folder Structure

```BASH
.
├── COPYING.MIT
├── README
├── conf
│   └── layer.conf
└── recipes-application
    └── helloworld
        └── helloworld.bb
```

4.  **Check for the Added Recipe:**

```bash
#Check For The New Recipe
bitbake-layers show-recipes -l <recipe_name>
#Show All Recipes In Project 
bitbake-layers show-recipes
#Show All Tasks In Recipe
bitbake -c listtasks <recipe_name>
```

## Recipe Content:

### 1-Important environment variables:

```bash
#Type of LICENSE Fot This Application
LICENSE = "CLOSED"
#LICENSE CheckSum
LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = ""
#Source URL To Fetch Code
SRC_URI = "git:<Repo_Link>;protocol=https;branch=master"
#Define Version Of THis Application

#Make Compile Tiem Dependences Between Two Recipes

#Make A Compile Time Alias For Recipe

#Make RunTime Dependences Between Two Recipes

```

### 2-Important Tasks in the Recipe:

```bash
#Fetch Source Code From Path
do_fetch () {:}
#After Fetch Task
do_unpack () {:}
#Patch Any Patch File Run After unpack
do_patch () {:}
#Specify any needed configure commands here
do_configure () {:}
#Specify compilation commands here
do_compile () {:}
#Specify install commands here
do_install () {:}
```

In the `do_compile` and `do_install` tasks, define how to compile and install the application.

```BASH
#Configure Compiling Task
do_compile () 
{
	#Compile
	${CXX} *.cpp -o <application_name> #Hello_World
}
#Configure Installing Task
do_install () 
{
	install -d ${D}${bindir}
	install -m 0755 <application_name> ${D}${bindir}
}
```
